This project is the second major project related to the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd019/), March 2019. It forms part of front end development learning in full stack engineering. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It also utilises [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io) library for basic component styling. 

To start run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

It will run the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The styling is very basic, as this is not a requirement for completion. 

Recognised improvements that should be made: convoluted code refactoring, I dislike the UX as per rubric, it should be different in the login flow but its implemented as instructed. Additionally there is inline styling in the codebase which is genreally bad practice - it should be extracted and moved to an external file.
