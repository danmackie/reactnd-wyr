This project is the second major project related to the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd019/), March 2019. It forms part of my front end development fast learning to accelerate knowledge in full stack dev. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It also utilises [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io) library for basic component styling. 

To start run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

It will run the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The styling is very basic, as this is not a requirement for completion but good for learing and self satisfaction to a small extent. 

Recognised improvements - some convuluted code, I dislike the UX as per rubric, it should be different in the login flow. Additionally there is inline styling in the codebase which is bad practice generally. This should be extracted and moved to an external file.
